# article-specifications-for-distinguishing-functions
This article defines and demonstrates a technique for assembling concise, lightweight specifications and unit tests for verifying the identity of a function (in order to distinguish it from other potentially similar functions), with a particular focus on functions that operate on binary data (such as cryptographic primitives). This technique sacrifices completeness in order to enable highly compact and portable representations of function specifications.
