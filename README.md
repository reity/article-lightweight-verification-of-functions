# article-lightweight-verification-of-functions
This article proposes and evaluates a technique for specifying lightweight unit tests that verify an implementation of a function, with a particular focus on verifying functions (such as cryptographic primitives) that operate on binary data. This technique sacrifices completeness in favor of concision, rapid implementation, and portability.
